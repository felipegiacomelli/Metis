These are some preliminary instructions for the 5.0 release of METIS.

1. You need to have a C compiler that supports the C99 standard.
   Gcc works just fine, but I have not tested it on many other architectures
   (any feedback/patches for different architectures are welcomed)

2. You need to have GNU make and CMake 2.8 (http://www.cmake.org/) installed.

3. At the top of Metis' directory execute 'make' and follow the instructions.

      make

4. To build on windows using Visual Studio follow the instructions in the
   file BUILD-Windows.txt.
